# React Vite Application

This is a **React** application built with **Vite**, providing a fast and efficient development experience. It utilizes **Tailwind CSS**, **Redux Toolkit**, and follows best practices for scalable and maintainable code.

Also instead of replicationg api calls using **api_data.json** I created an **Express.js** application: https://gallery-api-kwa8.onrender.com. For more details regarding routes take a look on swagger - /swagger.
